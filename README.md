# **DiceCup**

---

Put some dice in your dice cup and roll them. With very simple GUI.

Just add as much dice as you need to your dice cup.

Dice can have different colors and different amount of sides.

Functionality for changing color and sides is fully implemented, but not accesable through the GUI.

Followed the principles of the MVC-Pattern.
